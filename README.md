## Contributors 

This site was built, designed and hosted entirely by Derek Eder in his own free time for no money. Special thanks to Cristina Sladana from Cook County Commissioner Fritchey's Office, Danielle DuMerer from Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology, Bill McCaffrey from Chicago's Department of Housing and Chet Jackson from the West Humbolt Park Development Council for answering all my annoying questions.

Also a big thanks to my wife Aya for designing the logo, proofing and giving design feedback and Nick Rougeux for all his continuous sage style (CSS) advice.
